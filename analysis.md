## Facebook & TikTok vs. GDP & Median Age

In our initial analyis, we see that Facebook usage has a weak but positive correlation with both GDP per capita and median age, whereas TikTok usage has a weak but negative correlation with both of these values. However, there are a significant amount of countries in the bottom left corner of each of these charts, which appear to skew the overall shape of the data. We can reasonably conclude that these countries are outliers - or, in other words, that they would not follow whatever rule we are hypothesizing to exist for this data - because as these countries are so poor (and, as a result, have such low life expectancies), they also have very low internet penetration, which means there is no chance for them to attain a percentage of social media users that is comparable with other, richer countries.

After restricting the data, we see that overall the data appears to be uncorrelated, except in the case of TikTok vs age, where we see a clear (r=~.5) negative linear correlation between TikTok usage and median age, confirming what one might expect having used TikTok.

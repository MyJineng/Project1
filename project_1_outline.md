## Project Outline

### Topics:

- What population-wide statistics correlate most closely with propensity for social media usage? (Age, wealth, education... use scatter plots to show correlation and bar graphs to help visualize data by country)
- What about for individual social networks? Is there a difference between indicators for usage of different platforms? (Use scatter plots to show correlation and bar graphs to help visualize data by country/by network)
- What is the trend looking like for social media usage? What can we expect social media usage to look like in 2030? Can we use data for internet usage to make this prediction, or are they separate? (Line graphs)
- When looking at the most popular accounts on a given platform, does the distribution of nationalities look similar to the distribution of social media users by country? (Scatter plots/bar graphs)

### Data Used:

- https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/social-media-users-by-country (Social media users by country)
- https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/median-age (Median age by country)
- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD (GDP by country)
- https://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats/all/eritrea (Social network market share by country)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/top-1000-social-media-channels (2022 top 1000 influencers for TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram)

### Outline

1. Combine multi-year and multi-country data into single tables i.e.
	- Merge population statistics with social media usage
	- Merge social media usage from different years
	- Merge social media market share from different countries
2. Clean up data (remove rows with blank cells, remove unnecessary columns)
3. Add additional columns as necessary
4. Create visualizations - scatter plots, bar graphs, etc.
5. Calculate necessary statistics (lines of best fit, r2 values, uncertainty)
6. Written analysis answering questions
7. Compose README

### Visualizations

- Scatter plots (social media usage by country vs. age, vs. GDP, vs. education/HDI, same for market share for various popular social networks)
- Bar graphs (social media usage by country, network market share by country)
